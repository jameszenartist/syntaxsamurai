          Hello, I'm James Hansen ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building things that live on the
          internet.
          <br />
          <br />

          I like to code things from scratch and cultivate ideas that come to
          life in the browser.
          <br />
          I value simple content structure, clean design patterns and thoughtful
          interactions. I'm a software developer who specializes in building
          exceptional and accessible digital experiences. I'm 100% self taught,
          love to learn, and pick up skills very quickly. I've been coding for a
          few years, and it has been one of the most fulfilling and engaging
          experiences of my life!
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether I'm working with a difficult application, creating funky
          illustrations, or designing my next prototype, I see everything I do
          as a challenging opportunity for authentic creative self-expression.
          While programming, I get to use every creative bone in my body to try
          to motivate, entertain and inspire people.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
          improving my chops one problem at a time. Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy more
          than designing/developing good websites and applications for people.
          Itâ€™s really that simple.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not building stuff, I like doing:
          <br />
          <br />
          Calisthenics, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, drawing/painting, or exploring new
          places.
          <br />
